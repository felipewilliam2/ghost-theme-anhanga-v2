"""Placeholder for market-making simulation engine.

MVP v0 will:
- load trades for each token
- derive mid-price time series (or proxy) from trade prints
- simulate quoting around mid with conservative fill assumptions
- output per-market PnL + inventory drift + drawdown

Implementation will come after we confirm the dump works and data quality is good.
