## Decisions / Agreements (from chat)

### Polymarket MVP
- Build a **market-making MVP** with **simulation-first** for week 1 (collect metrics before trading).
- Data source: Polymarket public APIs (Gamma + Data API). Dataset: top 20 markets by liquidity.
- Data API has historical offset cap (~3000); accept "max allowed per token" as sufficient for MVP.
- Implementation of simulator deferred to **after 20:00 America/Sao_Paulo**.
- Created a dedicated private GitHub repo for this project:
  - https://github.com/felipewilliam2/polymarket-mvp (private)
  - branch main, initial commit 962da60.

### Supermemory
- LanceDB is operating; decision: **discard/disable Supermemory for now**.
- Revisit only later when integrating across other LLMs/environments.

### Bom Dia Amadeus
- Decision: keep **text-only** for now (skip audio) to simplify.

### Social repurposing automation (SEO Auditor + n8n)
- Networks: IG, FB, TikTok, LinkedIn, X, Threads.
- Start with **manual approval** (no auto-posting initially).
- Queue system for approvals: start with **Google Sheets** (MVP).
- Language: **always PT-BR**.
- Visuals: build in **Canva** for now; n8n generates text/structure guidance.
- Before building n8n workflow, align with SEO Auditor on a standard output contract:
  - TL;DR 5 bullets
  - step-by-step checklist
  - FAQ (3–5)
  - single CTA + UTM

### VPS upgrade
- Upgraded VPS specs: 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 200 GB NVMe, 16 TB bandwidth.

### Obsidian dailies
- Felipe wants automatic daily notes at **07:00 America/Sao_Paulo** using template `Tpl_Daily_Note_Automatico.md`.
- Implemented script:
  - /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/obsidian_daily_note.py
- Created today's daily note file:
  - obsidian-vault/05_Daily/2026-02-12.md
- Scheduled OpenClaw cron (systemEvent reminder) at 07:00 SP:
  - job id 3337ae4a-badd-48e4-bed3-9f1c6136f7fb
- Obsidian vault is versioned and pushed:
  - repo: https://github.com/felipewilliam2/felipe-obsidian-vault
  - pushed the daily + TODO update on 2026-02-12 (required `git pull --rebase` before push).

## Notes
- Reminder already scheduled for Polymarket simulator work after 20:00 SP:
